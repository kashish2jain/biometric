# HOW TO RUN?
# Python Script for an Iris Recognition System using OpenCV
1.For testing purposes I used an iris image database provided by CASIA.
2.I have provided,total 6 images of this database in zip file.
3.Any Two input images out of these 6 images,have to be provided by user,
then click on RUN, although 2 input images are already hard coded in program.
4.While the program is running, segmented image,normalized image,iris code, 
mask code of both the images will be shown,So total 8 images will be shown on screen,one after one.
User would have to first close each image, in order to see next image.
5.Once all images are shown(total 8 images), matching result will be shown on terminal screen.
